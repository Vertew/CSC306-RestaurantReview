<h1>Restaurant Review App</h1>
<p>
  The restaurant review app for android project was something I worked on solo for a mobile app development course at Swansea University in 2021. The objective of the course was to teach how to develop android apps using Kotlin and Android Studio, and as such the app here    was developed using said tools. I spent roughly 3 weeks working on it, utilising Firebase as a database to store data and implementing a simple user account system, restaurant search feature, and review system for each restaurant. I managed to achieve a result of 97%       for this particular piece of work. The project itself is no longer functional since it's very much outdated and some of the code is now deprecated or no longer supported at all, however the Kotlin source code for the app is still available to look at here if so desired 
  and images of the app while it was functional can be found on my portfolio website.

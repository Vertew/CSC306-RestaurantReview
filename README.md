<h1>Restaurant Review App</h1>
<p>
  The restaurant review app for android  project was something I worked on solo for a mobile app development course at Swansea University in 2021. The objective of the course was to teach how to develop android apps using Kotlin and Android Studio, and as such the app here   was developed using said tools. I spent roughly 3 weeks working on it, utilising Firebase as a database to store data and implementing a simple user account system, restaurant search feature, and review system for each restaurant.Â  I managed to achieve a result of 97%      for this particular piece of work.
